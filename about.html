                    <p>
                        My name is Tony, my nationality is Vietnamese with both my parents having been born in Vietnam. 
                        I mainly speak English and have limited Vietnamese proficiency. I have 3 sisters and we were all 
                        born in Australia. For my secondary schooling, I attended Parafield Gardens High School.
                        I am now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology (Game Development) at Flinders University.

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to complete a 20-week internship/placement before I complete my degree.
                        This is where I will improve my applied skills in coding and prepare myself for the workforce.
                        Leaving university, I plan to either enter a graduate program or a junior developer 
                        role at a software company. I will then work my way up to reach a leadership position. 
                        
                        This is to fulfill my dream of becoming a father, requiring me to 
                        work hard to financially support my family.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <h3>Keyboards</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2022, my friends introduced me to the world of custom mechanical keyboards.
                        I later joined a mechanical keyboard club at the University of Adelaide.

                    <p>
                        This hobby grew from my keyboard hobby.

                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        Video games have been apart of my live since I was 4-years old. I started playing Tetris and Mortal Kombat on the Super Nintendo 64. One of
                        my favourite childhood games is Neighbours from Hell.
